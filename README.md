# Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length').'
The bug occurs when a function attempts to access the 'length' property of a variable that is undefined.
The solution involves adding a check to ensure the variable is defined before accessing its properties.  This is a fundamental example of defensive programming in JavaScript.
